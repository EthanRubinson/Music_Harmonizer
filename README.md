Harmonizes and Plays Music in C Major on a Virtual Keyboard

Instructions:

Run the Java Program and then navigate to http://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual_piano/. Ensure the virtual piano has focus as the application simulates key presses. It first plays the non-harmonized version, followed by the transformation of single notes to chords, and finally by a random harmonization of the chords.
